      <P><FONT size=2>The privacy of our General Services Administration / Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) customers and affiliates has always been of
      utmost importance to FAS. Per our own policy for personal privacy, FAS will collect no personal information about you during your visit to our 
      site unless you choose to provide that information via web based forms or built in e-mail interfaces.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>Although the following discussion may seem exhaustive, FAS wants to ensure that you, our customer, fully understand our policy with 
      respect to your privacy. Our goal is to answer all questions concerning your privacy below.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT class=columntitle size=2>Information Automatically Collected:</FONT></P>

      <P class=normaltext><FONT size=2>During the duration of your visit to the FAS web sites, certain information is automatically collected which never 
      identifies the individual, but does provide system information so that we can best manage the performance of our web environment.</FONT></P>

      <P class=normaltext><FONT size=2>The only information which is automatically collected during your visit is as follows:</FONT></P>

      <UL class=normaltext type=disc>
		<FONT size=2>
        <LI>the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (i.e., erols.com, if you are connecting from an Erols account, or harvard.edu 
        if you are connecting from Harvard University's domain) 
		<LI>the date and time you access our site
		<LI>the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our site
		<LI>the type of browser you are using to visit the site </LI>
		</FONT>
	  </UL>

      <P class=normaltext><FONT size=2>This information enables the FAS web environment to present our data in the best possible method. For example, 
      a web site may look different when viewed by Microsoft's Internet Explorer versus Netscape's browser. Thus, our site determines which type of browser 
      you have and presents the web page according to the best practice for that specific browser.</FONT></P>

      <P class=normaltext><FONT size=2>Date and Time information and the domain you visited us from provide performance statistics so that our engineers 
      can better tailor the system based on geographical location and time of day visits.</FONT></P>

      <P class=normaltext><FONT size=2>Tracking links let us know how the customer found our site and the information provided by our site. This 
      gives our web engineers insight as to how they can better manage navigation and ensure that our customers find the information they are 
      looking for.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT class=columntitle size=2>How Does FAS use Cookies?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>A privacy statement cannot be complete without discussing the use of Internet cookies. A cookie is a small piece of information that 
      is sent to your browser -- along with a Web page -- when you access a Website.&nbsp; Your browser will only return this cookie information to the 
      domain where the cookie originated (in this case, gsa.gov).&nbsp; No other site can request it.&nbsp; A "persistent" cookie is a cookie that has been 
      assigned an expiration value. When the expiration value is exhausted, the cookie is automatically removed. The term persistent means that the cookie 
      exists in your browser even after you have shut down the session with the web site. Many sites use persistent cookies to track your progress through 
      the system and retain information with respect to where you have visited on the site. "Non-persistent" cookies only manage the session while your 
      browser is open. Once the browser is closed, the cookie disappears from your system. <B>FAS web sites do not use persistent cookies.</B></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT class=columntitle size=2>Privacy and correspondence via e-mail:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>When you send us personally-identifying information (i.e. an electronic mail message containing a question or comment, or by filling 
      out a site-form that e-mails us this information), we use this information to respond to your requests.&nbsp; We may forward your e-mail to other 
      Government employees who are better able to answer your questions.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>We want to make it clear that we will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, 
      unless you choose to provide such information to us.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>

      <P><FONT class=columntitle size=2>Personal Information Voluntarily Provided: The System of Records</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>In a system of records, where traditional paper collections of information are used to supplement web based electronic 
      forms, the personal record, in its entirety, whether electronic, paper or both are covered by the Privacy Act and will be treated as such.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>As discussed above, information that the customer provides to us through our web site, sent by postal, or provided by some other 
      method of transfer is held in confidence by FAS and is used only for the purposes of the business transaction it was intended for. Except for 
      authorized law enforcement investigations, we do not share any information we receive with any outside parties.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT class=columntitle size=2>Security, Intrusion and Detection</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>This is a Federal Government web site. For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, 
      this web system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or 
      otherwise cause damage.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage 
      habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records 
      Administrative Guidelines.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT class=columntitle size=3>WARNING</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>GSA eLibrary is not designed to support FTP or other methods of bulk access to its data repositories. Use of automated 
      data gathering tools or other programs that attempt to gather information from GSA eLibrary data sources are prohibited and when detected 
      will result in the user being blocked from access to GSA eLibrary.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable 
      under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Action of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. General Services Administration 
      / Federal Acquisition Services will enforce the law to its greatest extent to any individual who tampers with information made available on this 
      site.</FONT></P></td>
